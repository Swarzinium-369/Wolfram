This repository contains all the content required to lean Wolfram and some of the test projects that you can make using Wolfram. 

The Wolfram Language (/ˈwʊlfrəm/ WUUL-frəm) is a general multi-paradigm programming language developed by Wolfram Research. It emphasizes symbolic computation, functional programming, and rule-based programming and can employ arbitrary structures and data. It is the programming language of the mathematical symbolic computation program Mathematica.

## Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Model Training

<justify>It serves as a easy way for deploying Machine Learning and Deep Learning based Cloud Applications. Machine Learning with python is quite difficult as the installation and other stuff such as installing libraries and library versions which requires code to be updated frequetly as soon as the new update arrives. Machine Learning with Wolfram is easy cause it's a functional programming laguage and doesnot require you to code the whole stuff including with the logistics.

The Wolfram Language includes a wide range of state-of-the-art integrated machine learning capabilities, from highly automated functions like Predict and Classify to functions based on specific methods and diagnostics, including the latest neural net approaches. The functions work on many types of data, including numerical, categorical, time series, textual, image and audio.</justify>

The Wolfram Language has state-of-the-art capabilities for the construction, training and deployment of neural network machine learning systems. Many standard layer types are available and are assembled symbolically into a network, which can then immediately be trained and deployed on available CPUs and GPUs.

Some of the projects that has been developed have been mentioned here:

## Data Analysis
The Wolfram Language has unparalleled scientific data analysis capabilities, building on its strong base of algorithms, ability to represent and manipulate models symbolically, and integrated representation of real-world quantities and entities. It integrates many aspects of statistical data analysis, from getting and exploring data to building high-quality models and deducing consequences.

The Wolfram Language provides multiple ways to get data, starting with built-in curated data sources, importing from a variety of file formats, or connecting to databases. Basic processing of data, including computing statistical quantities, smoothing, testing, and visualizing, gives a first level of analysis. By adding models to the mix, such as distributional or regression models, you can answer a wider range of analysis questions or even provide predictive capabilities.

Projects related to Data Analysis will be updated soon:
