This repository contains all the content required to lean Wolfram and some of the test projects that you can make using Wolfram. 

The Wolfram Language (/ˈwʊlfrəm/ WUUL-frəm) is a general multi-paradigm programming language developed by Wolfram Research. It emphasizes symbolic computation, functional programming, and rule-based programming and can employ arbitrary structures and data. It is the programming language of the mathematical symbolic computation program Mathematica.

## Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Model Training

It serves as a easy way for deploying Machine Learning and Deep Learning based Cloud Applications. Machine Learning with python is quite difficult as the installation and other stuff such as installing libraries and library versions which requires code to be updated frequetly as soon as the new update arrives. Machine Learning with Wolfram is easy cause it's a functional programming laguage and doesnot require you to code the whole stuff including with the logistics.

The Wolfram Language includes a wide range of state-of-the-art integrated machine learning capabilities, from highly automated functions like Predict and Classify to functions based on specific methods and diagnostics, including the latest neural net approaches. The functions work on many types of data, including numerical, categorical, time series, textual, image and audio.
