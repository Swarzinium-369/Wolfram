## Introduction

<p align=justify>
The Purpose of the Project is to design a function that tells difference between two given expressions and denotes the changes that need to be made to reference expression(expr_1) to make it appear same as another expression (expr_2) and produce the same evaluation. The approach involves visualizing these expressions as trees and record these differences in expression as a list of  “Insert”, “Delete” and “ReplacePart” operations which on being applied to reference expression(expr_1) results in the other expression(expr_2).</p>
